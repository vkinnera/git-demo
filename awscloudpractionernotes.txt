AWS cloud practioner
using on demand
private - on prem
pay-as-u-go
server based - ec2 instance - VM
on demand
reserved
dedicated

AUTO SCALING/load balancing
removes adds ec2 instance based demand
increses decreses memory - load balancing

application architechture
monolithic
microservices

SNS - 

SQS -


severless computing is superior

AWS lambda comes under severless and code is triggered

AWS FARGATE - SERVERLESS


BATCHPROCESSING WORKLOAD EC2 INSTANCE - computer optimized

dedicated - 1 to 3 years


wrk load that withstand instance - spot instance



data centers and availability zones

combination DC's is AZ

aws backbone connects regions

vpc contains AZ's and AZ contain vpc subnets 
we can attach route table to vpc subnets

direct connect is faster than vpn

public subnet - Internet Gateway - bidirection
private subnet - NAT gateway(configured in public subnet and configured in private server)- unidirection

edge locations

block storage eg: local HDD
file storage eg: Win/ Lin Shared file system
Object storage Eg: NAS - S3

in single account - 100 buckets

EFS
EBS

RDS
DYNAMO DB

VPC, Subnets, RouteTable, IGW, SecurityGroup, EC2: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved, SavingsPlan, Dedicated Instance/Host, NACL, EBS, EFS, FSx, S3, RDS, DyDB...


shared responsibility model
 
IAM
MFA provided by IAM
Acc root user have complete access like owner

IAM roles 
mfa 

AWS organizations
contains serveral accounts

IAM is serverless

we can attach policy to OU

AWS secret manager	

we can apply organizational policies to accounts and OU	

AWS cloud watch
- moniter 

vpc - az - subnet - server - configure cloudwatch

based on load it will do auto scaling - vertical scaling

cloud trail - log service

AWS trusted advisor

cloud trail

AWS pricing and support
AWS free tier

AWS free tier - 12 months
consolidated volumes price will be calculated 

Basic support

lowest cost aws support plans includes aws trusted advisor

7 migration strategies

migration strategies traditional to SAS?
Repurchasing

AWS snow family?

intro aws
three deployment models - on prem hybrid cloud

 6 benefits of cloud computing
 Variable expenses, cost optimization, capacity, economies of scale, speed and agility, go global in minutes
 
 key concepts of global infra
 region , az , dc , edge
 Regions, AZs, Edge Locations and Outpost
 
 infra in your building
 outpost
 
 High availbility
 multi AZ's
 
 for DR
 
 AWS for edge locations
 Edge caching service - Cloud front = CDN
 
 list of services in compute 
 EC2, Lambda, EKS, ECS, fargate
 
 services in networking
 VPC, Route53, CloudFront, WAF, Shield
 
 what are the storage services?
 EBS, EFS, S3
 
 the storage clases in s3
 Standard, IA, Glacier
 
 what are the ebs volume types
 SSD, HDD
 
 what databases sevices?
 RDS, DynamodDB, ElastiCache, Neptune, Redshift, ledger
 
 data ware house - redshift
 in memory - elastic cache
 oracle - RDS
 serverless/ nosql - dynamodb
 
 what are the securty services? how to control aws acc?
 IAM and access mangemnet
 
 diff bw IAM user and IAM roles
 credential temporary - IAM user and I am Rolle -admin , I am role have temperary credentials by which also we can do most of the things
 
 
 how i do sysops?
 cloudwatch, aws trusted advisor
 
 7 migration strategies?
 Refactor, Retain, Rearchitect, Retire, Replatform
 
 how many pillors well archetected framework?
 6 - Cost Optiimization, Operational Efficiency, Security, Peformance Efficiency, Sustainability and Reliability
	
 programatic access to aws?  - credential expires 
 - CLI, SDK acess key and secret access key
 non programatic access to aws? 
 - IAM user, password
 
 benefits of using cloud when you have customer around world?
 multiple regions and edge locations - reduce latency
 
 which service unused ec2 capacity?
 SPOT instance
 
 for production env?
 reserved instances
 
 UAT?
 On-demand instance
 
 encrpted connection onprem and aws?
 site-site vpn
 
 direct connect provides the direct connection b/w on prem to aws
 
 what is NAT gateway?
 allows private outbound traffic
 
	what's the difference between Direct Connect and Site-site?
	Direct connect is dedicated private network to VPC?
	
	which aws service identify security group?
	AWS trusted advisor 
	
	NACL - subnet level - stateless
	security group - stateful
	
	cloudtrail- api watching, cloudwatch - metrics, alerts etc
	
	company consistent and private connection?
	AWS direct connect
	
	RDS DB in Multi az's
	
	
	DR is multi region
HA is multi AZ

advantages of ec2 in multiple AZ
preventing point of failure
increses the availablity of application
